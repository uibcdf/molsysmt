# Native MolSysViewer integration

**Role:** normative provider/consumer boundary
**Decisions:** legacy retirement under uibcdf/molsysmt#354 /
uibcdf/molsysviewer#186; redesigned tools under uibcdf/molsysmt#421 /
uibcdf/molsysviewer#264

MolSysMT supplies the native molecular-system, scientific calculation and H5MSM
backend used by MolSysViewer. The source now ships a redesigned
`molsysviewer_molsysmt` integration, discovered through the new
`molsysmt-tools = molsysviewer_molsysmt.tools` entry point on a compatible host.
Its initial experimental facade provides six `basic` read/query tools, native
independent extraction, managed native removal and their root aliases under
`view.addons.molsysmt`, with synchronization controls. Other edit families and
graphical task panels remain pending. Old root entry points and retired adapter files remain
unsupported; source support is not installed-package qualification. Domain addons
remain owned by their providers and MolSysViewer's independent extension API.

## Supported paths

- Use `msm.view(molecular_system)` for the supported form-agnostic visualization
  route. The `molsysviewer.MolSysView` form adapters remain available.
- Use MolSysViewer's native loading, selections and `view.interactions` APIs
  for its supported Studio workflows. MolSysMT calculates scientific results;
  MolSysViewer validates, attaches named analyses and controls their presentation.
- Direct MolSysMT interaction calculations return the documented optional
  `Interactions` result. They do not need an addon and do not automatically
  attach every calculation. Named analyses accompany a `MolSys` and persist
  through the supported H5MSM 0.5 public conversion paths.
- For an operation beyond the native Studio surface, use the public MolSysMT
  tool and then reload the result or reconcile it through the Viewer-owned
  `view.apply_system_edit` API with the required index correspondence. Coordinates,
  topology edits, cached interactions and scene state obey their respective
  documented invalidation/reconciliation contracts.

This is not a promise that Studio mirrors every public MolSysMT function.
Viewer owns its GUI, sessions, selections, scene state and reconciliation API;
MolSysMT owns the scientific operation and molecular data fidelity.

## Migration

Migrate calls to retired addon editing/rendering APIs to native Viewer
operations where provided, or to public `msm.basic`, `msm.build`,
`msm.structure`, `msm.topology`, `msm.pbc`, `msm.physchem` and
`msm.interactions` tools. The redesigned facade deliberately reuses the `view.addons.molsysmt` name
without restoring those retired methods. Do not silently rewrite legacy
serialized UI/session state. Viewer owns scene/session migration.

The removed adapters wrapped existing public tools; their panel state and
rendering projection were UI-specific, not another scientific engine. Their
source and tests remain in Git history. The
[archived architecture](archive/assessments/molsysviewer_addon_before_retirement_20261009.md)
records the old surface without presenting it as current behavior.

## Packaging and evidence

Current-source wheels, source distributions and installed-runtime checks must
include the reviewed new tools sources/entry point and reject legacy addon
files and declarations. The installed runtime probe exercises automatic discovery
and a bound scientific read against native MolSysMT on a compatible host. Native Rust/resource/form metadata
and public runtime checks remain required. No new dependency is introduced.
The installed check inspects MolSysMT's own distribution, so it does not reject
other components' domain addons.

Previously qualified files and their source receipts remain unchanged. New
validators describe future artifacts produced from this source; they do not
retroactively qualify or rewrite old candidates. Provider cleanup alone does
not qualify a new Viewer candidate, browser runtime or installed package pair.
The 1.0 publication pause and exact-candidate gates remain authoritative.
Pre-generated documentation HTML contains its original embedded Viewer runtime;
refresh it through the normal final documentation qualification with the agreed
Viewer source, rather than rewriting frozen JavaScript snapshots by hand.

## Tools addon implementation in progress

The maintainer has accepted a redesigned provider-owned tools addon under
uibcdf/molsysmt#421, coordinated with uibcdf/molsysviewer#264. The
[implementation record](pending_proposals/molsysviewer_tools_addon.md) owns
the source ledger, expert scientific API mirror and task-oriented panels.
Preserve native mutation/return semantics; qualified bound-system edits will
synchronize by default, while independent results require explicit adoption.
Provider documentation will explain capabilities and use; Viewer documentation
owns general management, creation and catalogue links.

The first source delivery has real read-tool parity/lifecycle and packaging
guards. See the [user reference](../docs/content/user/tools/molsysviewer_tools.md).
Broader coverage, edit synchronization, panels and exact installed qualification
remain pending under the implementation issue.
The withdrawn observer request uibcdf/molsysmt#413 remains closed.


## Development metadata receiving

Automatic discovery consumes installed distribution entry points. A source
checkout can also contain ignored local `molsysmt.egg-info` generated before the
new entry point existed; Python metadata discovery may prefer it to a correct
editable installation in site-packages. Inspect the selected distribution's
public `entry_points` before changing the host or registering modules manually.
If that local metadata is stale, regenerate it from this checkout with its
configured setuptools backend:

```bash
python -c 'from setuptools import setup; setup(script_args=["egg_info"])'
```

Use the selected development interpreter. This refreshes generated metadata,
not a scientific implementation, public package, dependency floor or host
allowlist. Restart the importing process and verify ordinary discovery from
both checkout working directories. The initial receiving exercise reproduced
this shadowing and then ran both user-guide code blocks plus the bound extraction
without explicit addon registration. These are development-source checks, not
clean installed-artifact qualification.


## Managed retained-axis removal

The source facade admits `basic.remove` with native scientific options/defaults
and a keyword-only `update_view=True`. Independent native outputs remain caller
owned; `in_place=True` edits the actual bound MolSys and retains native None.
The preparation adapter uses the provider's own selection/index validation and
native candidate-publication contract, supplying authoritative retained maps to
the generic Viewer coordinator. No second scientific removal engine exists.
Atomic native rejection is qualified only while the same state dictionary remains;
uncertain writes need explicit recovery. The receiver rejects empty in-place axes
before science; independent native empty results retain their native behavior.

`get_sync_status` returns detached integration metadata and `sync_view` retries
projection without repeating science. Deferred removals compose maps; scene
indices remain unavailable until reconciliation. Native readers are serialized
with managed writes but read pending scientific results. Raw external writes and
returned live references remain outside automatic synchronization.

Source guards are `tests/molsysviewer_molsysmt/test_remove_tools.py` and the
existing read/packaging guards, received against the coordinated Viewer host
under uibcdf/molsysviewer#264. Broader namespace/effect qualification and graphical
task panels remain pending under uibcdf/molsysmt#421. This does not qualify any
published package pair or authorize a release.


Source receiving checkpoint: Viewer `9da52e5500c9f8637e2f6f76eea0eb81ce783882`. Routine smoke/docs/full-fallback
source routes now pin that managed-edit receiver; explicit candidate inputs retain
precedence. Local receiving passes 17 remove/control cases, 20 read/extract cases,
30 packaging guards and all three guide Python blocks in
`molsyssuite@uibcdf_3.14`. Viewer retains its once-run full-suite result (3,266 pass,
21 skips, two subsequently corrected inventory/TypeScript failures), focused
corrections and the real Chromium receiving evidence under uibcdf/molsysviewer#264.
These are working-source checks, not a frozen installed pair. Hosted exact-source
CI remains to be inspected after this delivery; no runtime dependency floor,
package, tag or release is changed.
