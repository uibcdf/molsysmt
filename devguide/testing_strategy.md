# Testing Strategy

## Framework
Use `pytest`. Tests live under `tests/` and should mirror package structure.

## Fixtures
- Prefer shared molecular systems from `tests/conftest.py`.
- Avoid ad hoc downloads unless explicitly testing remote forms.
- Assert fixtures are not `None` to fail early.

## Optional Dependencies
Tests that require soft dependencies must guard availability and skip cleanly.

## Determinism
Tests must be deterministic and reasonably fast. Use bundled systems in
`molsysmt.systems` when possible.
